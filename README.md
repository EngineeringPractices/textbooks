# Hello!

This is a list of links to textbooks originally created by [openstax.org](http://openstax.org) that have been converted into GitHub repositories so you can **derive your own copy** (aka [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)), **suggest edits** (aka [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/)), or **errata reporting** in the text (aka Issues) using tools GitHub provides.

# The Books

The "canonical" version of the books are in [openstax.org](http://openstax.org) and these repositories are mirrors of those versions. These books are licensed CC-BY (or CC-BY-SA) so you can customize them for your course!

# What do I need to know?

If you want to customize the books you will need to:

- create a GitHub account
  - See the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) for an introduction
- [learn how to Fork a Repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) (it's easy!)
  - fork one of the books listed above
- [learn about Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), a wiki format (similar to what wikipedia uses)

If you want to view your custom book you will need to:

- do the steps above (make sure you change something about the book first!)
- go to `http://${YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}.github.io/${THE_REPOSITORY_NAME}`
  - If you see a `404` page then you probably did not _change something about the book first_ (Try editing [_config.yml](./config.yml) and changing the title to something like `Prof X's Biology Book derived from OpenStax ...` and making a commit)

If you want to suggest edits (like typos or broken images) you will need to:

- [learn about Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/proposing-changes-to-a-project-with-pull-requests/)

If you want to let other people edit your version of the book you will need to:

- [learn about GitHub permissions](https://help.github.com/articles/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository/)
